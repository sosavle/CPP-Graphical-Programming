# What's this?

This is a collection of graphical C++ projects! Most of them use the library.h, developed by University of Miami professor Dr. Stephen Murrell. As you can see below, they involve an eclectic coctail of fun little projects :D

In alphabetical order, they are:

# Calculator

It's a nice, visual calculator! Button presses are animated to give it a nice touch :)

# Calendar

Ever used the cal command on Unix? Well, this is me trying to build that command and realizing all the crazy little complications that come with dealing with leap years and time in general

# CannonGame

Just like the title says! Pick an angle and a velocity and attempt to shoot down the enemy base

# Clock

Display the current time in an analog clock!

# HappyRandomTown

It's a happy, randomly-generated town, so it's different every time!

# Maze

A simple maze explorer game. The maze is read from a file, so you can make your own too!

# Stars and Flags

A small project where I play around with drawing stars and flags and flags with stars

Plots weather data!
